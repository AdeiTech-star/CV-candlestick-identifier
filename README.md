# CV-candlestick-identifier 📊

## Overview
Candlestick patterns are visual representations of price movements in a trading session. They convey important information about market sentiment, and classifying them can be a first step in automating technical analysis.

## Implementation Steps 🛠️

### Step 1: Data Collection
- Collect images of candlestick charts for various patterns (e.g., doji, hammer, shooting star, etc.)
- Create synthetic candlestick patterns using Python libraries like mplfinance

### Step 2: Preprocessing
- **Image Resizing:** Standardize the size of all input images
- **Color Conversion:** Convert images to grayscale for simplicity (optional)
- **Feature Extraction:** Identify key features (e.g., body, wick lengths)

### Step 3: Model Selection
Choose from multiple approaches:
- **Classical Approach:** 
  - Use image processing techniques
  - Edge detection and template matching to identify shapes
- **Machine Learning Approach:**
  - Train a classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machine or Random Forest)
  - Use extracted features (e.g., body-to-wick ratio, position of wicks)
- **Deep Learning Approach:**
  - Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Learn patterns directly from image data

### Step 4: Training
- Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets
- Train the model using appropriate metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall

### Step 5: Deployment
- Build a pipeline to input candlestick chart images
- Output predictions
- Integrate with trading application or use for analysis
