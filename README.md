# CV-candlestick-identifier
Candlestick patterns are visual representations of price movements in a trading session. They convey important information about market sentiment, and classifying them can be a first step in automating technical analysis.


##Actionable steps
Step 1: Data Collection
Collect images of candlestick charts for various patterns (e.g., doji, hammer, shooting star, etc.).
Create synthetic candlestick patterns using Python libraries like mplfinance.
Step 2: Preprocessing
Image Resizing: Standardize the size of all input images.
Color Conversion: Convert images to grayscale for simplicity (optional).
Feature Extraction: Identify key features (e.g., body, wick lengths).
Step 3: Model Selection
Classical Approach: Use image processing techniques like edge detection and template matching to identify shapes.
Machine Learning Approach: Train a classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machine or Random Forest) on extracted features (e.g., body-to-wick ratio, position of wicks).
Deep Learning Approach: Use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn patterns directly from image data.
Step 4: Training
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Train the model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
Step 5: Deployment
Build a pipeline to input candlestick chart images and output predictions.
Integrate with a trading application or use for analysis.
